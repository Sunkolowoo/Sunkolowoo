			<p> we recognizes individuals as active agents in managing their own health care in areas including health promotion; disease prevention and 			control; self-management; providing care to dependent persons; and rehabilitation, including palliative care. It does not replace the health 			care system, but instead provides additional choices and options for healthcare.  

			<h2>What are self-care health interventions and who uses them?</h2>
			Self-care interventions encompass tools that support self-care and actions that improve the care of oneself. Self-care interventions include 				evidence-based, high-quality medicines, devices, diagnostics and/or digital interventions that can be provided fully or partially outside 			formal health services and can be used with or without the direct supervision of health and care workers. Self-care actions include practices, 			habits, and lifestyle choices.

			Some people may have good knowledge of certain self-care interventions and feel comfortable using them independently from the outset, while 			others may need more support and guidance before they can accept and use them independently. Self-care interventions that need initiation by a 			health and care worker, or additional health and care worker support (e.g. to follow up on a positive test), must be linked to the health 			system and supported by it in order to be safe and effective.

			<h2>Scope of the problem</h2>
			Every year 100 million people are plunged into poverty due to out-of-pocket expenditure for health. Furthermore, underserved and marginalized 			populations, often lack access to quality health information, services and products and face stigma and discrimination in healthcare. There is 			an urgent need to find innovative strategies that go beyond a conventional health sector response to address these challenges in accessing 			quality healthcare.

			The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the unique and critical role that self-care interventions can play in mitigating disease and saving lives 			through personal self-care actions, such as wearing masks and physical distancing, and national level prioritization of self-care 			interventions. Examples of quality, cost-effective self-care interventions include timely and accurate diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 as an 			essential part of a comprehensive COVID-19 response strategy. Self-care actions to promote individual emotional resilience are also important 			for the well-being of health and care workers. 

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			Before recommending specific self-care interventions, it is important to have evidence that they are beneficial to health and cause no harm at 			individual and/or population levels.

			Use of unregulated and substandard products, incorrect or unclear health information or lack of access to health and care workers and/or health 			facilities for guidance or management of side effects or complications are challenges that need to be addressed when promoting or generating 			demand for these interventions. Currently one of the biggest challenges is ensuring that products are available to those who need them and that 			they do not place added financial burden on individuals.

			Assessing and ensuring an enabling environment in which self-care interventions can be made available in safe and appropriate ways must be a 			key initial piece of any strategy to introduce or scale-up these interventions. Creating an enabling environment not only requires action from 			the health sector, but also other sectors as well, for example, the education, justice and social services sectors, because self-care 			interventions are mostly accessed and/or used outside formal health services. 

			<h2>Self-care as a complement to the health system</h2>
			Self-care interventions offer a strategy to improve universal health coverage, reach people in humanitarian situations, and improve health and 			well-being.

			WHO’s conceptual framework on self-care interventions has core elements from both “people-centred” and “health systems” approaches, underpinned 			by the key principles of human rights, ethics and gender equality.

			Self-care interventions can connect with digital platforms and technologies and be incorporated into the education of health workers for 			maximum scale and reach. Health literacy, including digital literacy, is also important for the uptake of self-care interventions and provides 			the foundation on which individuals are enabled to play an active role in improving their own health.

			In addition, in times of major disruptions to the normal functioning of national health systems, caused by health emergencies, self-care 			interventions can provide an important alternative to the usual health facility- or health and care worker-based services.</p>
